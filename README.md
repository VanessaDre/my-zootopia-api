# Animal Info Web Generator

This Python project allows users to search for animals and generates a simple HTML page with basic information about them, such as diet, location, and type.  
The data is fetched in real-time using the [API Ninjas Animals API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/animals).

## 📦 Features

- Search any animal by name
- Uses live API data
- Simple and clean HTML output
- Modular structure (data fetching and website generation separated)
- Secure API key handling using `.env` and `dotenv`

## 📌 Project Description

The goal of this project is to practice working with APIs, environment variables, modular Python files, and HTML generation.  
It is structured into two parts:
- **Data Fetcher**: Gets the data from the API.
- **Website Generator**: Creates a styled HTML page from the data.
